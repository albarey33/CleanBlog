<h4 id="brief-description">Brief Description:</h4>

<p>Use Case: To import data on parts (due to source system limitations) and integrate them into one CSV file. The script first create a list of the required Excel files names located in the source folder by using list.files and regex to define a pattern. Then a function is defined to read the data inside the Excel files, this create tibbles. The function uses readxl::read_excel(filename). For convenience, the defined function also converts the logical fields to character using ‚Äúinherits‚Äù. Finally the tibbles are merged into one CSV using do.call bind_rows.</p>
